There are many different types of objects in Python. Let's start with the most common object types: <i>strings</i>, <i>integers</i> and <i>floats</i>. Anytime you write words (text) in Python, you're using <i>character strings</i> (strings for short). The most common numbers, on the other hand, are <i>integers</i> (e.g. -1, 0, 100) and <i>floats</i>, which represent real numbers (e.g. 3.14, -42.0).</p>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4TVTiySkGAnm"},"source":["<a align=\"center\">\n","    <img src=\"https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%201/images/TypesObjects.png\" width=\"600\">\n","</a>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dJv5OSiQGAnm"},"source":["<p>The following code cells contain some examples.</p>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"id":"XeZK3c01GAnn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1659570557275,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":325,"user":{"displayName":"TOMAS TORRES MARTINEZ","userId":"10418480319999726884"}},"outputId":"79ef1c73-e629-40a7-f984-1b8f44ca2d99","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["11"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["# Integer\n","\n","11"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"id":"xTQTcwNMGAnn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1659570559123,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":365,"user":{"displayName":"TOMAS TORRES MARTINEZ","userId":"10418480319999726884"}},"outputId":"f841ab05-8082-463d-d4b3-89afc10c64f7","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["2.14"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}],"source":["# Float\n","\n","2.14"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"id":"zszOWrOnGAnn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1659570560591,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"TOMAS TORRES MARTINEZ","userId":"10418480319999726884"}},"outputId":"93ef427a-0d3c-45a3-8031-3bbff5eb0c8d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Hello, Python 101!'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"source":["# String\n","\n","\"Hello, Python 101!\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PEt1RLPxGAnn"},"source":["<p>You can get Python to tell you the type of an expression by using the built-in <code>type()</code> function.
